    "# Using Enron data-set, perform 3 analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction:\n",
    "Enron started life as a regional natural gas pipeline company, the result of a merger between Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth in 1985. Lay was credited with transforming Enron into the world's largest energy trading company and America's seventh-biggest corporation. The Enron scandal, revealed in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, which was one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world."
